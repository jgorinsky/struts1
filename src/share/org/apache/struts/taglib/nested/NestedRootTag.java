/**
 * NestedRootTag.
 *
 * The only other addition in this nested suite of tags.
 * This tag allows for a nested structure to start without relying on the bean
 * and workings of the FormTag. Useful for view pages that don't update when
 * returning to the server, or use hyperlinks rather than form submits.
 *
 * The Bean that it uses can come out of a jsp:useBean tag or define another
 * bean that's already in scope. As long as the other Struts tags can find the
 * bean by name, it'll work.
 *
 * It's simply recognised by the helper class and it's property is added to the
 * nesting list.
